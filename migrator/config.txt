# Apps usually fail to install due to missing dependencies and/or incompatible Android version. After the last failed attempt, `/data/media/migrator/failed_restores` is renamed to `failed_restores.old`. `migrated_data*` and `failed_restores*` folders are refreshed automatically upon ROM migration. These can be manually removed after data restore. `/data/media/migrator/migrated_data/` is auto-removed.

# The count (minutes) starts after package manager and storage are ready. This gives users time to reboot to recovery and run "sh /data/M" to remove incompatible data - before automatic restore begins. Lowering this number is NOT recommended. Besides, there are always manual restore options.
