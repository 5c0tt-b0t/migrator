description=This module protects select apps+data from being wiped out on a regular TWRP factory reset. Thus, greatly reducing the amount of effort necessary for setting up a new system. Additionally, adk is a full backup solution, thanks to rsync and OpenSSH capabilities. Read the documentation (README.md) prior to installing/upgrading.
