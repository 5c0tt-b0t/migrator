description=This is a ROM migration utility. On the flip side, it is a full backup solution, thanks to rsync and OpenSSH capabilities. Note: this is in no way associated, nor does it have anything to do with the app "Migrate". While both have similar goals, they work differently and are not developed by the same individual/group.
