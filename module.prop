description=At the time of this writing, by default, a standard TWRP wipe (factory reset) obliterates everything in /data/data, except media, misc/vold and system/storage.xml. This module protects select apps' data from being wiped out. Thus, greatly reducing the amount of time required for setting up a new system. Additionally, adk is a full backup solution, thanks to rsync and OpenSSH capabilities. Protected data and respective APK's are automatically backed up. Bonus: TWRP boot time and backup sizes are greatly reduced when a significant amount of app data is protected. Read the general documentation (README.md) prior to installing/upgrading. NEVER "downgrade" directly; uninstall and reboot first.
