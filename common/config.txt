App Data Keeper (adk) Config
/data/media/adk/config.txt


SYNTAX

  Incremental apps' data backup frequency in hours (value must be an integer, default: 8)
  
      bkpFreq=8

  Include all user and *updated* system apps

      inc

  Include pkgName (this works for any app, and it's the only way to *include non-update-able system apps*)
  
      inc pkgName

  Exclude *user* app (overrides "inc" and "inc pkgName")
  
      exc pkgName

  Advanced incremental, scheduled backups (rsync -rtu --inplace $bkp_line)
  
      bkp [extra rsync option(s)] [SOURCE(s)] [DEST]
    
    Tip: use $i for internal storage and $e for external media (largest partition) as opposed to writing full paths.
    
    For rsync-specific details, refer to its man page.

NOTES

  A bare "inc" affects user and updated system apps only.
  
  An empty/null config disables all features. If data protection was enabled, app data is automatically moved back to /data/data on the next boot. Data is also automatically restored the next boot after adk is disabled/uninstalled.

  Only inc'd (included) apps are backed up.

  Updated system apps are treated as user apps.

  Valid config lines have no leading nor trailing pounds/spaces and/or any other additionall characters.


DEFAULT CONFIG

inc
