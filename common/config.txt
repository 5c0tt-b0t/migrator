App Data Keeper (adk) Config
/data/media/adk/config.txt


SYNTAX

  Incremental apps data backup frequency in hours (value must be an integer, default: 8)

      bkpFreq=8

  Include all user and *updated* system apps

      inc

  Include pkgName (this works for any app, and it's the only way to *include non-update-able system apps*)

      inc pkgName

  Exclude *user* app (overrides "inc" and "inc pkgName")

      exc pkgName

  Advanced incremental, scheduled backups (rsync -rtu --inplace $bkp_line)

      bkp <extra rsync option(s)> <SOURCE(s)> <DEST>

    Tip: use $i for internal storage and $e for external media (largest partition) as opposed to writing full paths.

    For rsync-specific details, refer to its man page.

  Wipe /data (exc. adb/, data/.*provider.*/, media/, misc/(adb/|bluedroid/|vold/|wifi/), ssh/ and system(""|.*)/(0/accounts.*|storage.xml|sync/accounts.*|users/)) and /cache (exc. magisk.*img and magis_mount/) after apps+data migration (untested on encrypted data)

      wipe

  Do not migrate/auto-restore apps+data

      noauto


EXAMPLES

  App data protection setups

    All user and *updated* system apps, except Spotify

      inc

      exc com.spotify music

    Only stock apps matching "mail" (non-update-able)

      inc mail

    Stock terminal, plus all user & *updated* system apps, except Spotify

      inc

      inc term

      exc com.spotify.music

    All user and *updated* system apps, except *updated* Google Play Services

      inc

      exc com.google.android.gms

  Backup setups

    Full internal storage

      bkp --del $i/ $e/full_internal_bkp

    Specific data

      bkp --del $i/Download $i/Dukto $e/important_data

    Some data to some remote machine

      bkp -e "ssh -i /path/to/key" SOURCE user@host:/DESTINATION

    Sync all backed up apps and respective data to a remote machine

      bkp -e "ssh -i /path/to/ssh/key" $appBkps $appdataBkps user@host:/DESTINATION


NOTES/TIPS

  A bare "inc" affects user and updated system apps only.

  An empty/null config disables all features.

  Any line containing leading and/or trailing pounds/spaces and/or any other additional characters is ignored.

  Instead of having multiple inc/exc lines, globbing/regex patterns can be used to match multiple packages (i.e., "exc google", "inc sp.*fy|ctionary|mail", without quotes).

  Only inc'd (included) apps are backed up.

  The word "provider" matches all packages which store/provide contacts, SMSs/MMSs, call logs, etc..

  Updated system apps are treated as user apps.

  When the "wipe" feature is enabled, adb/, data/.*provider.*/, media/, misc/(adb/|bluedroid/|vold/|wifi/), ssh/, system(""|.*)/(0/accounts.*|storage.xml|sync/accounts.*|users/) and /cache/(magisk.*img|magisk_mount/) also survive factory resets. Note that all Magisk modules are preserved across adk factory resets. WARNING: "wipe" hasn't been tested on encrypted data! Thus,it's disabled by default. Leave it alone if you don't have at least a recent FULL (inc. internal media) /data backup on a different storage device!
